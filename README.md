This is a memory game.

I used this project to practice react, css, js and html.
There is no way to lose in the game, but it can be implemented.

The game starts when the player choose the level he wants to play.
The game adds some points when you make a pair correctly.
When all pairs are found, the player can choose to play again or go back to the beginning.
